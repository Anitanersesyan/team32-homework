 /* Create two variables called yearOfBirth and yearFuture. Assign these your own age and a future year.
 What type will these two variables be? Using yearOfBirth and yearFuture calculate the age and store that in a variable called age.

Log out this string: "You will be 40 years old in 2027". With 40 being the result of the age variable and 2027 being the yearFuture variable. 
(Hint use string concatenation) */
